import type { LucideIcon } from 'lucide-react';

// NavItem, Appointment, Patient, MedicalStaff types have been removed
// as their consuming components, pages, or data files were deleted.

// If you re-add features that need these types, you can reinstate them here.

// Example of a type that might remain:
// export interface SimpleSettings {
//   theme: 'light' | 'dark';
//   language: string;
// }

// It's possible no custom types are needed if the app is extremely simple.
// LucideIcon is kept in case any remaining UI elements use it directly, though unlikely in this minimal setup.
