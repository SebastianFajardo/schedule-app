// AppointmentReminderSchema and NewAppointmentSchema and related mocks (mockDoctors, mockSpecialties, mockLocations)
// have been removed as their consuming components/pages were deleted.

// If you re-add features that need these schemas, you can reinstate them here.

// Example of a schema that might remain if some basic functionality were kept:
// export const UserProfileSchema = z.object({
//   username: z.string().min(3, "Username must be at least 3 characters."),
//   email: z.string().email("Invalid email address."),
// });
// export type UserProfileFormValues = z.infer<typeof UserProfileSchema>;
